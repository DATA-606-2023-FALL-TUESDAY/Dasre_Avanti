## Problem Statement & Background:
The primary objective of this project is to develop a deep learning model that can accurately distinguish between real and AI-generated images. With the rapid advancements of generative artificial intelligence models and the convincing nature of fake images, it is becoming increasingly difficult for humans to distinguish them from the real ones. This is a challenging problem as the increasing quality of AI-generated images has led to concerns regarding the authenticity and trustworthiness of visual content. This project aims to address this problem with effective use of computer vision and deep neural networks to detect whether an image is real or has been generated by AI?

By end of this project, I aim to explore & find answers to following research questions:
-	Can a machine learning model accurately distinguish between real and AI-generated images based on underlying visual features?
-	What are the key visual features or cues that differentiate real images from AI-generated ones?
-	How does the performance of computer vision algorithms based on convolutional neural networks (CNNs) vary in detecting AI-generated mages?
-	How do various image processing techniques and data augmentation techniques influence the model performance?
-	How do different pretrained models help to improve the accuracy of the model?

Potential real-world use cases of this project include
-	Content Moderation by social media websites and internet companies.
-	Media organizations can use this model to verify authenticity of images and videos to combat the spread of fake news.
-	This model can be expanded to similar domain specific use cases such as Digital forensics & counterfeit product detection.


## Dataset

Data Sources: The CIFAKE dataset[1] is created and published in the year 2023. The dataset contains 60,000 synthetically-generated images and 60,000 real images (collected from CIFAR-10). 

Dataset link: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/birdy654/cifake-real-and-ai-generated-synthetic-images
Dataset Stats: 
-	The dataset contains two classes - REAL and FAKE.
-	Number of train image samples - 1,00,000
-	Number of test image samples - 20,000
-	Data size: Around 120 MB


Phase 2: Exploratory Data Analysis
-	Analyze/Plot distribution of the target classes in train and test datasets.
-	Use python based visualization frameworks like numpy, opencv to load & preprocess the images.
-	Use matplotlib to load and view the images samples for both real & fake classes. 
-	Augment the input data using techniques such as random resizing, cropping, or rotating.


Phase 3: Data preparation & Model Building
-	Data splitting: Use random splitting strategy (unless there is an imbalance in class distribution) to split the training dataset into training and validation datasets.
-	Preprocess data: Load images as arrays, standardize the image arrays & resize the images.
-	Image Augmentation: Apply various image augmentation methods like random cropping, resizing, and rotating.
-	Develop 2-3 different CNN architectures and experiment with different pooling layers.
-	Experiment with various pre-trained models like VGG, ResNet, Densenet, and fine-tune the classification layer to enhance prediction accuracy.
-	Create plots to visualize model's loss on training & validation data. Evaluate the model on the Test dataset.
-	Visualize sample images with actual & predictions classes. Conduct a detailed analysis of the outcomes by utilizing a Confusion Matrix to pinpoint the areas where the model is making errors.
Using the trained model in a Web Application:
-	Use Gradio to build a simple web application where users can upload an image and get predictions it is a REAL or FAKE image.
